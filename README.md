### Learn how to train custom YOLO object detection models on a free GPU inside Google Colab! This video provides end-to-end instructions for gathering a dataset, labeling images with Label Studio, training a YOLO model, and running it on a local computer with a customizable Python script. The video shows how to use YOLO11, but it also works with YOLOv8 and YOLOv5.
